Overview
This is an end-to-end, multi-agent, multi-modal AI system designed to automate and streamline the reporting, analysis, and resolution of real estate infrastructure issues. Built with scalability, professionalism, and user experience in mind, this assistant takes natural user input (via text, voice, or image), processes the information contextually, and delivers a structured report to both the user and relevant authorities. It features memory architecture, visual and language-based understanding, auto-documentation, and intelligent communication pipelines.
The system is composed of intelligent agents for dedicated tasks, a meta-controller for fallback and rerouting, and a modular backend compatible with microservices. It integrates cutting-edge AI models for language, vision, and speech processing, and incorporates automation pipelines for document generation and email dispatch.
